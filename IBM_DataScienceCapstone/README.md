## Executing Program

You'll find several files and folders but for the most part, it's pretty self-explanatory.

But within you'll find:

    - App
    - Data
    - Notebooks 
    - CapStone.pdf

### App

A Dash app to dynamically display analytical SpaceX data. 

To run the app after installing the repo via git, you'll have to install some dependencies.

#### Environment/Dependencies

Requirements.txt is located in the root of the IBM_DataScienceCapstone directory

Virtual Env

Once you have activated your Venv.

```
pip install requirements.txt

```

### Data

Contains our cleaned data, a template capstone_pptx for our final report, and a db that was created 

### Notebooks

Tasks 1 - 8

A quick note Task 7 is just a template the app is actually in the App directory
